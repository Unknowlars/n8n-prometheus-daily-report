## QA Checklist for this sample

- [ ] Status cards render in email clients (Gmail/Outlook/mobile)
- [ ] SLA and trend tables aligned on small screens
- [ ] Priority Actions preserve monospace/command formatting
- [ ] Host table wraps long hostnames correctly
- [ ] Emoji/icons degrade gracefully in plain-text fallback
